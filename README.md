# latex_figure_cleaner
A python script to remove unused figures in latex projects. Also a good complementary of [arxiv_latex_cleaner](https://github.com/google-research/arxiv-latex-cleaner).

## Usage
```
python cleaner.py path_to_image_folder path_to_log_file
```

## Acknowledgements
Main codes borrowed from [LaTeXFiguresCleaner](https://github.com/sbmueller/LaTeXFiguresCleaner)

Compared to LaTeXFiguresCleaner, the cleaner will remove the unused figures in subfolders recursively.
